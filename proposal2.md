# Arduino Project

For my second proposal, I'm thinking of making a very simple arduino project.

## Summary

I'll make a lamp/light that responds to movement around it.

It should be able to sense objects on all sides of it; the closer the objects get, the more intense the colors become 

## Component Parts

It will be based on project number 8 (https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-great-arduino-projects-for-beginners/) and I'll use a jar, hot glue, clay, and arduino.

I'm not enirely sure how it will work, but when the light senses an object moving closer, it will change color. I'm thinking it will be similar to the ways some of the robots that you showed us in one of the videos in class worked.

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1:
- Week 2:
- Week 3:
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

## Completed Work

Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.

## References and links

Tutorials, comments, videos, magazine articles - anything you found that helps you understand your project.
