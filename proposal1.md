# Quiz

My first idea involves creating a quiz using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Summary

I'll be creating a quiz that includes around 10 questions. At the end, it will grade the person taking the quiz based on how many they got correct .
Anyone can take the quiz and get a score. I'm thinking the topic of the quiz will be a true/false type quiz and I'm pretty sure the topic will be climate change 

## Component Parts

HTML, Javascript, and CAA.

When a user clicks true or false, the output will be a new statement that they have to evaluate. When you finish answering the last question, the it will respond with your score (ie "3/10 correct").

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1:
- Week 2:
- Week 3:
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

## Completed Work

Upload photos and videos of your completed final project!

Also upload the code that makes up your project to your repository.

## References and links

Tutorials, comments, videos, magazine articles - anything you found that helps you understand your project.
